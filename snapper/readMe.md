## Snapper

Recreation of [Snapper 2](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.jontelang.snapper/) for personal use only. I really like Snapper 2, however it had a lot of features I didn't use, so this is my thinned down version

Out of respect for Snapper 2 being a paid tweak, I never put the binary in a disassembler. I happened to see `SnapperWindow` in a visual debugger, and everything else in this project was written from scratch. 

This project is slightly different than other projects in this repository because of the reasons above, and that it has TODOs
